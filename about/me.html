            <p><font color="blue">Dr. Long is a professor, and Vice Dean of Center of Intelligent Acoustics and Immersive Communications (CIAIC) at Northwestern Polytechnical University, and an expert of “thousand youth talents plan” of China. </font></p>
<p><font color="blue">September 2006</font>, admitted to the School of Life Sciences, Xi’an Jiaotong University, majoring in biomedical engineering. During Ph.D., went to the Institute of Biomedical Engineering, Department of Consulting Engineering, Hsinchu Chiao Tung University, Taiwan, and cooperated with the Institute of Robotics and Cognitive Systems at the University of Lubeck, Germany.</p>
<p><font color="blue">January 2014</font>, successfully completed the doctoral graduation defense. The defense topic was “New Time Domain Acoustic Noise Reduction Optimization Algorithm Based on Rectangular Filter”, the defense chair was Professor Zhang Jianbao, and the defense committee members included: Chen Jingdong, Yin Qinye, Hua Dengxin, Wang Supin, Yan Xiangguo and Zhu Jian</p>
<p>Research Work carried out dissertation was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China <font color="blue">(project numbers: 11274249 and 61120106013)</font>.</p>
<p>Doctoral dissertation systematically explores several important issues in speech noise reduction, and the topic selection has important theoretical significance and application value.Main Innovative Works of the paper are:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The orthogonal decomposition theory of linear prediction is extended to a variety of speech noise reduction algorithms based on rectangular filters, and the influence of each parameter on noise reduction performance is analyzed by simulation, and the results are optimized.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The time-domain noise reduction method based on rectangular filter is studied, which reduces the computational complexity and improves the practicability of filter noise reduction without affecting the noise reduction performance.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The acausal method is introduced into the time-domain noise reduction algorithm based on rectangular filter, and the optimal delay factor is found through experiments, which effectively improves the output signal-to-noise ratio, reduces speech distortion, and increases voice quality.</p>
</li>
